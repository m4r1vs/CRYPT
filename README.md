## Inspiration 🎉
Every bitcoin wallet is usable. But only for Nerds and enthusiasts like us. It is time to change that. CRYPT is the first bitcoin wallet which has all the bells and whistles like support for the lightning network but doesn't require any knowledge and is as easy to use as just swiping a credit card while ensuring first-class-privacy and all other benefits of bitcoin!
## Ideas
Currently CRYPT is nothing more than a bunch of ideas and concepts. I haven't written any actual code yet. One idea mentioned by reddit user [/u/Beastly_Beast](https://www.reddit.com/user/Beastly_Beast) is to have two seperate accounts in the wallet. One called "Savings" and one "Cash". The savings-wallet would be a plain old bitcoin wallet and the cash-wallet would consist of one or more lightning channels. My goal is to automate the creation and closing process of these channels so that the user doesn't have to worry about it. All he has to know is that when he wants to buy stuff he should use his cash-wallet because the transactions happen almost instantanous and without real fees.
